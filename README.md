# Make a Smile

## Overview
Make a Smile is a responsive web application built with React, TypeScript, and Bootstrap, designed to facilitate a trustworthy and transparent platform for donating clothes, food, and devices. In a world where trust is paramount, our application provides a secure and direct channel for individuals to make non-monetary donations to organizations in need, bypassing common concerns associated with financial contributions.

### Mission
Our mission is simple: to create a seamless connection between donors and organizations, enabling the donation of goods rather than money. We aim to alleviate the fears associated with monetary donations by providing a transparent, efficient, and user-friendly platform for giving back to the community in a tangible and meaningful way.

### Features

Direct Communication: Enables direct communication between donors and organizations to arrange donation logistics.
Real-Time Updates: Users receive updates on the status of their donation offers, including acceptance, rejection, or requests for more information by organizations.
#### For Organizations:

Offer Management: Ability to accept or decline donation offers through the platform, streamlining the process of gathering necessary items.
